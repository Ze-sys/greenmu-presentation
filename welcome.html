    <p class="text-lg mb-4">The Problem Formulation Process (PFP) is a practical, structured approach for tackling complex engineering and innovation challenges. Instead of trying to solve a big, tangled problem all at once, PFP helps you break it down into smaller, clearly-defined issues that can be addressed more effectively.</p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">PFP guides you to identify and organize three types of problems:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Contradictions</span>: Where two requirements or effects are in conflict, and improving one makes the other worse.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Probing Leads</span>: Open-ended questions or areas that need further investigation to understand the system or find new opportunities.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Secondary Issues</span>: Additional problems that arise as a consequence of addressing the main issues, or that are discovered during analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">These are the main deliverables of the PFP. By making these issues explicit, the process sets the stage for focused, creative problem solving in later steps.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Use the navigation bar above to explore each step, see how the problem is analyzed, and view diagrams and tables that map out the cause-and-effect relationships in the system.</p>
